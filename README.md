 # Lecture Notes of Linear Algebra [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/apm/l/atomic-design-ui.svg?)]()

These lecture notes were documented when I first learned Linear Algebra online(MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra). Since I am now resolved to incline to computational design rather than traditional architectural design, I feel compelled to review these knowledge. I am trying to revise the notes into digital format.



The following libraries are required among these Jupyter Notebooks.

- [x] Matplotlib
- [x] NumPy
- [x] Python
- [x] SymPy
